# C-Major-Project
Library Management System
This project is a basic Library Management System implemented in C.
It is designed to simulate the essential operations of a small or medium-sized library.
Library staff can perform tasks such as:

Adding books

Registering members

Searching books

Issuing books

Returning books

Displaying all books

Displaying all members

The system uses structures, arrays, and simple menu-driven logic to manage the library operations.

The code follows a modular approach and is separated into:

1. Header File – library.h

2. Function File – functions.c

3. Main Program File – main.c
